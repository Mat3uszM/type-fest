Create a type that makes the given keys required. You can specifiy deeply nested key paths. The remaining keys are kept as is.

Use-case: You want to define as required only a some nested keys inside a model.

@example
```
import type {SetRequiredDeep} from 'type-fest';

type Foo = {
	a?: number;
	b?: string;
	c?: {
    ca?: number
    cb?: boolean
  }

type SomeRequiredDeep = SetRequiredDeep<Foo, 'a' | 'cb'>;
// type SomeRequiredDeep = {
// 	a: number; // Is now required
// 	b?: string;
// 	c: {
//    ca?: number
//    cb: boolean // Is now required
//  }
// }
